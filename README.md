# Bike Sharing-Linear Regression Assignment
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants a model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes after quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19

Essentially, the company wants to understand â€”
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
**So interpretation is important!**

## General Information
- Business Problem :US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants a model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes after 
  quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19
- What is the dataset that is being used?: day.csv file


## Conclusions
- temp,yr and season_winter have gigh coefficient values hence these features are most important in 
  determining the demand
- The r2_score for both train and test model are almost same
- r2 score for train: 0.8366617562511378
- r2 score for test : 0.8085456594473557
